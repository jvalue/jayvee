## Summary

This RFC introduces an initial, limited valuetype concept that allows users to define custom atomic valuetypes 
based on builtin primitive valuetypes. Common constraints can be defined and applied to valuetypes, allowing to restrict the 
set of valid values for a given valuetype.

## Motivation

As open data is not bound to a particular domain, users need a way to define domain-specific semantics in regard 
to values. This RFC proposes a domain-agnostic way to accomplish this using user-defined valuetypes.

A valuetype is used to define a set of valid values, so invalid values can easily be identified. In many cases, it 
is sufficient to specify a valuetype based on a primitive valuetype (like `text` or `decimal`) and apply 
constraints to further limit the set of values. Consider the following excerpt from a [dataset found on mobilithek.info](
https://mobilithek.info/offers/-8739430008147831066):

| EVA_NR  | DS100 |      IFOPT      |        NAME        | Verkehr |  Laenge   |  Breite   |      Betreiber_Name       | Betreiber_Nr | Status |

| 8001510 | TDSA  | de:08237:8009:2 |  Dornstetten-Aach  |   RV    |  8,48291  |  48,4733  | DB Station und Service AG |              |  neu   |

Some values in the columns could be described using valuetypes, e.g. `Laenge` and `Breite` are decimals ranging 
from -90 to 90 as they are supposed to be geographic coordinates. Further examples for valuetypes will be addressed 
in upcoming sections.

## Explanation

### User-defined valuetypes based on primitive valuetypes

Valuetypes are defined using the `valuetype` keyword, giving a name and specifying the underlying primitive valuetype. 
constraints can be added via the `constraints` collection, see [this upcoming section](#adding-constraints-to-valuetypes)
for details.

Here are some examples:

```jayvee
valuetype IFOPT oftype text {
   constraints: [ ... ];
}

valuetype Longitude oftype decimal {
   constraints: [ ... ];
}
```

### Defining constraints for valuetypes

Constraints can be defined using the `constraint` keyword, providing a name and by selecting the type of 
constraint. There are several builtin constraints to choose from, see
[the next section](#builtin-types-of-constraints) for details. Constraints are configured by assigning values to attributes (similar 
to block types).

Some examples:

```jayvee
constraint IFOPT_Format oftype RegexConstraint {
   regex: /[a-z]{2}:\d+:\d+(:\d+)?/;
}
```

```jayvee
constraint TrafficValueRange oftype WhitelistConstraint {
   whitelist: [ "FV", "RV", "nur DPN" ];
}
```

```jayvee
constraint GeographicCoordinateRange oftype RangeConstraint {
   lowerBound: -90;
   lowerBoundInclusive: true;
   upperBound: 90;
   upperBoundInclusive: true;
}
```

#### Builtin types of constraints

There are a number of constraints that are built into the language. They should be sufficient to cover most use cases.

##### For any primitive valuetype

**`WhitelistConstraint`**: Configured via a collection of values to be considered valid. Any other values are 
considered invalid.

**`BlacklistConstraint`**: Configured via a collection of values that are considered invalid.

##### Specifically for `text`

**`RegexConstraint`**: Configured via a regex. Only text values that are matching the given regex are considered valid.

**`LengthConstraint`**: Configured via a minimum and/or a maximum length for text values to be considered valid.

##### Specifically for `decimal` and `integer`

**`RangeConstraint`**: Configured via a lower and an upper bound (each either inclusive or exclusive). Only values in 
that range are considered valid.

### Adding constraints to valuetypes

To add constraints to a valuetype, they have to be added to the `constraints` collection of that valuetype:

```jayvee
valuetype MyValuetype oftype text {
   constraints: [
       MyRegexConstraint,
       MyLengthConstraint
   ];
}

constraint MyRegexConstraint oftype RegexConstraint {
   // ...
}

constraint MyLengthConstraint oftype LengthConstraint {
   // ...
}
```

Note that the constraints have to be suitable regarding the primitive valuetype.

### Syntactic sugar for common constraints

There are syntactic sugar variants for common constraints. They can be used within the `constraints` collection of 
a valuetype. Using such a syntax implicitly creates a corresponding constraint with no name.

#### For `RegexConstraint`:

```jayvee
valuetype IFOPT oftype text {
   constraints: [
       /[a-z]{2}:\d+:\d+(:\d+)?/
   ];
}
```

#### For `WhitelistConstraint`:

Enumeration of all valid values, each separated with `|`:

```jayvee
valuetype DB_Traffic oftype text {
   constraints: [
       "FV" | "RV" | "nur DPN"
   ];
}
```

#### For `RangeConstraint`:

```jayvee
valuetype Longitude oftype decimal {
   constraints: [
       -90 <= value <= 90
   ];
}
```

In this context, `value` is a keyword that stands for the value being inspected. Conceptually, the expression above 
desugars to `-90 <= value AND value <= 90`.

Note that it is also allowed to use `<` instead of `<=` for exclusive bounds.

### Assigning valuetypes to columns

The assignment of a user-defined valuetype to a column is similar to how it is done with primitive valuetypes:

```jayvee
block DbStopsTableInterpreter oftype TableInterpreter {
    header: true;
    columns: [
        "EVA_NR" oftype integer,
        "DS100" oftype text,
        // Here we assign a user-defined valuetype to the column "IFOPT"
        "IFOPT" oftype IFOPT,
        "NAME" oftype text,
        "Verkehr" oftype DB_Traffic,
        "Laenge" oftype Longitude,
        "Breite" oftype Latitude,
        "Betreiber_Name" oftype text,
        "Betreiber_Nr" oftype integer,
        "Status" oftype text
    ];
}
```

## Drawbacks

- No syntactic sugar available for reusable constraints
- No arbitrary boolean expressions can be used to define custom constraints
- Users are unable to apply boolean operators to constraints other than `AND`

## Alternatives

- Allow arbitrary constraints using boolean expressions that can be combined with boolean operators
  - Unsure how this could be expressed, esp. when constraints of a valuetype are written down as a collection
  - The syntactic sugar versions in this RFC could be turned into inline boolean expressions

## Possible Future Changes/Enhancements

- Introduce enums as a language feature rather than implicitly via a `text` valuetype with a `WhitelistConstraint` 
  applied
- Readers and writers to handle different value representations
- Mechanisms for handling invalid values
- More mighty constraints using arbitrary boolean expressions
- Concept for composite value types
- Concept for SI units and operators
