## Quick start

1. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run generate` to generate TypeScript code from the Jayvee grammar definition.
3. Run `npm run build` to compile all projects.
4. In Visual Studio Code, press `F5` to open a new window with the Jayvee extension loaded.
5. Create a new file with a `.jv` file name suffix or open an existing file in the directory `example`.
6. Verify that syntax highlighting, validation, completion etc. are working as expected.
7. Run `node dist/apps/interpreter/main.js` to see options for the CLI of the interpreter; `node dist/apps/interpreter/main.js <file>` interprets a given `.jv` file.

In case you run into problems, make sure to use the current LTS version of Node.js and npm.

## Using Jayvee in VS Code

To set up Jayvee locally in VS Code, you need to install the latest Jayvee VS Code extension and the Jayvee interpreter.

To install the most recent extension, go to our [latest release](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee/releases/latest) 
and download the `jayvee.vsix` file from the release assets.
Next, go to [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) and 
follow the instructions for installing the downloaded extension.

For globally installing the latest version of the Jayvee interpreter,
see [here](./apps/interpreter/README.md#actual-installation).
