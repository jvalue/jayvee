# Jayvee

Jayvee is a domain-specific language (DSL) for automated processing of data pipelines.
The Jayvee interpreter allows executing such data pipelines on local machines.
Data engineers can use Jayvee and its interpreter to clean and preprocess data for later activities like data science or machine learning.

## Roadmap

Explore a glimpse of our upcoming features in the following list. This overview is broad and subject to evolution. We're excited to share our vision of the exciting journey ahead, and we invite you to accompany us on this adventure!

- &#9989; Blocks and pipes 
- &#9989; Simple valuetypes and constraints
- &#9989; Natively support table-based data
- &#9989; Column-based transformations
- &#9989; Describe blocks via builtin blocktypes in Jayvee
- &#9989; Compose logic of multiple blocks via composite blocktypes
- &#8987; Multi-file Jayvee to distribute programs over multiple files (see [RFC 0015](./rfc/0015-multi-file-jayvee/0015-multi-file-jayvee.md))
- &#8987; Improve the syntax of valuetypes (see [RFC 0014](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee/pull/409))
- &#8987; Jayvee formatter
- &#8987; Further extractors and sinks
- &#129300; Reusable libraries (with a package manager)
- &#129300; Composite valuetypes (with multiple fields)
- &#129300; Natively support tree data (XML, JSON)
- &#129300; Valuetypes parsers (to read and write different formats)
- &#129300; Customizable invalid value handling (default value, average, median, interpolation, ...)
- &#129300; VSCode Debugger
- &#129300; Blocktypes with multiple ports (e.g., for merging different data)


Anything missing, or you have ideas how some of the items on the list could be approached?

## Contribute

In case you would like to contribute to Jayvee, please have a look at our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development Quickstart

1. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run generate` to generate TypeScript code from the Jayvee grammar definition and the standard library.
3. Run `npm run build` to compile all projects.
4. In Visual Studio Code, press `F5` to open a new window with the Jayvee extension loaded.
5. Create a new file with a `.jv` file name suffix or open an existing file in the directory `example`.
6. Verify that syntax highlighting, validation, completion etc. are working as expected.
7. Run `node dist/apps/interpreter/main.js` to see options for the CLI of the interpreter; `node dist/apps/interpreter/main.js <file>` interprets a given `.jv` file.

In case you run into problems, make sure to use the current LTS version of Node.js and npm.
