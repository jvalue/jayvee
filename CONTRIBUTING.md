# Jayvee Contributing Guide

Welcome to the contributing guidelines for Jayvee! Thank you for considering to contribute to our open source project. 
We appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve our project.


## Code of Conduct

Before we begin, please take a moment to review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
It outlines the expectations of behavior and respect that we expect from all contributors to our project.


## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways in which you can contribute to Jayvee:
- Reporting issues or suggesting new features
- Designing an RFC
- Writing code
- Reviewing code
- Creating and updating documentation


### Reporting Issues or Suggesting New Features

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee/issues) on our GitHub repository. 
Please make sure to include as much information as possible, such as steps to reproduce the issue, error messages, and screenshots. 
We recommend to use one of the existing issue templates to ensure consistent form of the issues.
We appreciate any input you have to offer.


### Designing an RFC

We use an RFC process to design new language features. Please read about our current RFC process in the documentation: [Language Design Process (RFCs)](https://jvalue.github.io/jayvee/docs/dev/rfc-process). You can find previous RFCs [here](/rfc/).


### Writing Code

If you're interested in writing code for Jayvee, please follow these steps:
1. Fork our GitHub repository to your own account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes. Please name your branch something descriptive, such as "feature/my-new-feature" or "bugfix/my-bug-fix". If your contribution addresses an existing issue, please use the branch format "XXX-my-new-feature" where XXX is the issue id.
4. Make the changes you want to make on your branch.
5. Test your changes thoroughly to make sure they work as expected.
6. If you're planning on making a significant contribution, you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a legal document that ensures that the project and its users are protected, and that the contributions you make are licensed appropriately. You can find the [CLA](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/course-resources/contributor-agreement/) here. Please sign it and send us a scan to [jvalue@group.riehle.org]. The CLA Assistant GitHub Action acts as second redundant mechanism.
7. Commit your changes and push your branch to your forked repository.
8. Submit a pull request to our main repository.
9. Self-review your pull request. If you have open questions, please add comments to the code accordingly.

Please make sure to include a detailed description of your changes in your pull request and document additions and change on the language in the [developer docs](/apps/docs//docs/dev/). 
We appreciate comments explaining why you made specific changes, and any context that may be useful for reviewers.


### Reviewing Code

We appreciate any help with reviewing code. 
If you have some time to spare, please take a look at our open pull requests and provide your feedback. 
You can leave comments directly on the pull request or on the code itself.


### Creating and Updating Documentation

If you have experience with technical writing, we would appreciate any help with creating or updating our documentation. 
Please submit a pull request with your changes to the `apps/docs` project.
