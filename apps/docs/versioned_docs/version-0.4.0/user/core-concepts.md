# Core Concepts

The core concepts of Jayvee are `Pipelines`, `Blocks`, and `ValueTypes`.

## Pipelines

A `Pipeline` is a sequence of different computing steps, the `Blocks`.
The default output of a block becomes the default input of the next block, building a chain of computing steps.
In the scope of a `Pipeline`, you can connect these blocks via the `pipe` syntax:

```jayvee
pipeline CarsPipeline {
    // Assumption: blocks "GasReserveHttpExtractor", "GasReserveCSVInterpreter", "GasReserveTableInterpreter", and "GasReserveLoader" are defined

    GasReserveHttpExtractor
		-> GasReserveTextFileInterpreter
		-> GasReserveCSVInterpreter
		-> GasReserveTableInterpreter
		-> GasReserveLoader;
}
```

## Blocks

A `Block` is a processing step within a `Pipeline`.
It can have a default input and a default output.
We differentiate the following types of `Blocks`:
- `ExtractorBlocks` do not have a default input but only a default output. They model a **data source**.
- `TransformatorBlocks` have a default input and a default output. They model a **transformation**.
- `LoaderBlocks` do have a default input but nor a default output. They model a **data sink**.

The general structure of a `Pipeline` consisting of different blocks is the following:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[ExtractorBlock] --> B(TransformatorBlock)
    B --> C(TransformatorBlock)
    C --> D(LoaderBlock)
```

The common syntax of blocks is at its core a key-value map to provide configuration to the block.
The availability of property keys and their respective `ValueTypes` is determined by the type of the `Block` - indicated by the identifier after the keyword `oftype`:

```jayvee
block GasReserveHttpExtractor oftype HttpExtractor {
    // key: value
    url: "https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/_tools/SVG/js2/_functions/csv_export.html?view=renderCSV&id=1089590";
} 
```

In the example above, the `url` property of type `text` is defined by the corresponding `HttpExtractor` block type.

Blocks can be either defined as part of the language, called `builtin` or defined as composition of existing blocks by users in Jayvee, called `composite`. See the documentation for [Composite Blocks](./composite-blocks.md).

## ValueTypes

A `ValueType` is the definition of a data type of the processed data.
Some `Blocks` use `ValueTypes` to define logic (like filtering or assessing the data type in a data sink).
We differentiate the following types of `ValueTypes`:
- `Built-in ValueTypes` come with the basic version of Jayvee. See [Built-in Valuetypes](./valuetypes/builtin-valuetypes).
- `Primitive ValueTypes` can be defined by the user to model domain-specific data types and represent a single value.
  `Constraints` can be added to a `Primitive ValueType`.
See [Primitive Valuetypes](./valuetypes/primitive-valuetypes).
- `Compound ValueTypes`: UPCOMING.

```jayvee
valuetype GasFillLevel oftype integer {
    constraints: [ GasFillLevelRange ];
}

constraint GasFillLevelRange on decimal:
    value >= 0 and value <= 100;
```

## Transforms
`Transforms` are used to transform data from one `ValueType` to a different one. For more details, see [Transforms](./transforms.md).

```jayvee
transform CelsiusToKelvin {
  from tempCelsius oftype decimal;
  to tempKelvin oftype decimal;

  tempKelvin: tempCelsius + 273.15;
}
```
