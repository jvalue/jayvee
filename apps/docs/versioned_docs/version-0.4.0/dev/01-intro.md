Before planning a contribution, please read the [design principles](./05-design-principles.md) and consider if your changes fit the vision expressed there.

The overall project is licensed under the `AGPL-3.0-only` license and is compliant to the [REUSE Specification](https://reuse.software/spec/) by the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/).
Because of this, contributions are required to adhere to the license and follow that specification.
More details on this topic can be found [here](./02-dev-processes/03-licensing-and-copyright.md).

And last but not least, please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project overview

The Jayvee repository is located [here](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee) on GitHub.
It uses an [Nx mono-repository](https://nx.dev/) setup and contains all related projects, most notably the Jayvee language server and interpreter.
Please have a look at the [architecture overview](./03-architecture-overview.md) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are required for development.
It is recommended to use their LTS version to avoid any potential compatibility issues.
Also, refer to this [quick start guide](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee#development-quickstart) for developers.

In order to run the Jayvee VS Code extension during development, VS Code is required as IDE.
Using VS Code also allows installing the [Langium VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=langium.langium-vscode) for better IDE support when working with Langium grammar files.
