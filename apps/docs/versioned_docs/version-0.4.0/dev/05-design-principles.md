2. **Explicit modeling** over hidden magic.
3. **Composition** over inheritance.
4. **Flat structures** over deep nesting.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Through this work, we also have come to explore:

5. **Libraries** over language features.
